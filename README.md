# ChatApp Backend Server [server]
App is built with Nodejs framework Express.

To run the app locally in your system:Navigate to the project folder in your terminal: `npm install` would install all the dependencies and `nodemon` would start a local ldev server at http://localhost:3000/.
 I havent completed test cases for backend yet, time was short, although  I can update the repo later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ChatApp Client Server [client]
App is built with Angular , angular-cli version 1.4.6
Run `ng install` 
Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Run `ng build` to build the project. with '-prod' flag you can create build for production , all the production ready code should be under dist/ folder

# Tests
