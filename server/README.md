# ChatApp-server
App is built with Nodejs framework Express.

## To run the app locally in your system:
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
`npm install` would install all the dependencies and 
`nodemon` would start a local ldev server at http://localhost:3000/.
 I havent completed test cases for backend yet, time was short, although  I can update the repo later.


# In case of any discrepancy please call me at +919818490692 or mail at dineshnagarit@gmail.com , I could have make it more rich in features but due to time constraint wasnt able to do it. please let me know if there is any query or suggestions.
